# Encryption_Decryption

Abstract
---

This is a group project about encryption and decryption which was created using concepts of Linear Algebra. Cryptography refers to tools and techniques to secure communication and information which can be created using mathematical concepts and algorithms to make it harder to decipher messages Various external libraries of Java are required to run this program which are mentioned below. Concepts like matrix multiplication, determinants, inverse matrix were used in this project.

Features
--
After encrypting the message, it is converted to QR Code which has to be scanned to decrypt the message. After scanning the QR Code, the encrypted message is displayed. Enter the key and the decrypted message is on your screen.
